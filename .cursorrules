# Cursor Rules for Figma AI Buddy Project

## Code Style
- Prefer TypeScript, Node 20, fetch API
- Never print secrets. Use env vars
- Replies must be under 2â€“4 seconds when possible
- Style: concise functions, JSDoc on exported functions

## Project Structure
- Keep a tidy structure so Cursor can "see" everything
- Pin files like `figma-webhook.ts`, `figma.ts`, and `openai.ts` so they're always in context
- When asking for changes, say *where* (e.g., "In `figma-webhook.ts`, add HMAC verification")

## Working with Cursor
- Use **CMD+K** to ask Cursor to *modify the open file*
- Pin files (click the pin icon) like `figma-webhook.ts`, `figma.ts`, and `openai.ts`
- Keep a `TODO.md` so Cursor can track your plan

## Environment Variables
- All secrets should be in environment variables
- Reference them as `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`
- Never hardcode API keys or secrets

## Error Handling
- Always wrap API calls in try-catch
- Log errors with context
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
